# ðŸŒ±KrishiBazaar:A Transparent Digital Marketplace and platform for Farmers and Vendors
## Theme: Agriculture
KrishiBazaar is a web-based platform designed to bridge gap between farmers and agricultural vendors in Nepal.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
### Problem statement: 
Farmers and agricultural vendors in Nepal face inefficiencies in trading quality seeds and produce due to:   
- Lack of price transparency  
- Unfair middlemen exploitation  
- Unreliable logistics and delivery costs  
- Limited access to trustworthy buyers/sellers  
 This results in financial losses for farmers and vendors, hindering agricultural growth.   
 ### Objective
 To build a transparent online marketplace that connects farmers and vendors, allowing secure buying and selling of seeds and crops in Nepal that:   
- Allows vendors to register shops, list seeds with prices and set locations  
- Enables farmers to buy seeds or sell their produce directly at fair prices  
- Automatically calculates distance-based delivery fees for transparency  
- Provides verified user profiles to build trust.   

### Solution Overview
KrishiBazaar is a web-based platform designed to bridge gap between farmers and agricultural vendors in Nepal in which:   
- Vendors register their shop with a location and list seeds with prices and other details.  
- Farmers log in, view vendor listings, and purchase seeds by searching their requirements.  
- Farmers can also sell their own produced crops at self-determined prices.  
- During transactions, delivery locations are selected, and distance-based delivery fees are calculated and shown, promoting trust and transparency.
